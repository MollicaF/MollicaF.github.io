We revisit the relationship between CD and WF. We propose that lexical representations store context-sensitive frequencies and assume that language comprehension includes predictive processes that generate probability distributions for upcoming words. When variables that contribute to lexical processing are factored out, remaining effects reflect the need probability of a word in a specific context. This conceptualization, formalized, as an active context constructivist framework predicts that as contextual constraint increases CD effects will weaken. Moreover, WF effects should emerge in the three-condition design used in most experimental studies comparing CD and WF. We confirm these predictions using frequency judgments, eye-tracking during reading with three-condition designs, and a corpus analysis of eye-tracking data from natural texts.

What makes a useful partitioning? Why do different cultures sometimes have different partitions? Characterizing the constrained variation and universals in human semantic categorization remains a foundational question for cognitive science. One prominent approach argues that semantic categories across languages are shaped by pressure to communicate efficiently, typically captured by a tradeoff between cognitive economy and communicative accuracy. This idea has recently been formulated and tested using tools from machine learning and information theory, and in particular, the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle (Tishby et al., 1999; Zaslavsky et al., 2018). The IB framework for semantic categorization makes formal predictions about the fine-grained structure and evolution of semantic categories, and has been directly connected to the coordination of grounded semantic categories in multi-agent reinforcement learning settings. Here, we review the framework and its empirical evidence across languages and semantic domains, and contextualize it with respect to alternative formulations of efficient communication. We focus on how this theoretical framework may address important questions including: Are attested languages shaped by pressures towards optimal communication? To what extent can this principle predict the constrained semantic variation observed across languages? Which assumptions about communication/cognition provide a better explanation of typological data? We demonstrate the application of this framework with a concrete example from the color domain.","tags":null,"title":"Information-theoretic and machine learning methods for semantic categorization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Contrary to classical theories in linguistics, recent theories have framed overinformativeness as an efficient means of grounding reference in perceptual information of high discriminability to facilitate listener comprehension. However, the generalisability of such theories is constrained by the methodological challenge associated with reliably manipulating the perceptual discriminability of naturalistic stimuli. Here, we overcome these methodological challenges, using methods from psychophysics to manipulate the perceptual discriminability of colour and material attributes in a reference-production experiment. We provide a robust validation of the view that overinformative reference is driven by speakers grounding expressions in attributes of high discriminability.

Next, two pre-registered text generation experiments (n=280) tested two leading hypotheses regarding how these complex structures enter into legal documents in the first place. In line with the *magic spell hypothesis*, we found people tasked with writing official laws wrote in a more convoluted manner than when tasked with writing unofficial legal texts of equivalent conceptual complexity. Contrary to the *copy-and-edit hypothesis*, we did not find evidence that people editing a legal document wrote in a more convoluted manner than when writing the same document from scratch. From a cognitive perspective, these results suggest law to be a rare exception to the general tendency in human language towards communicative efficiency. In particular, these findings indicate law's complexity to be derived from its performativity, whereby low-frequency structures may be inserted to signal law’s authoritative, world-state-altering nature, at the cost of increased processing demands on readers.

We also compared the entirety of the U.S. Code (the official compilation of all federal legislation currently in force) with a large sample of recently published texts from six baseline genres of English. We found that laws remain laden with features associated with psycho-linguistic complexity—including center-embedding, passive voice, low-frequency jargon, capitalization,and sentence length—relative to the baseline genres of English, and that the prevalence of most of these features has not meaningfully declined since the initial onset of the plain-language efforts. These findings suggest top-down efforts to simplify legal texts have thus far remained largely ineffectual, despite the apparent tractability of these changes, and call into question the coherence and legitimacy of legal doctrines whose validity rests on the notion of laws being easily interpretable by laypeople.","tags":null,"title":"So much for plain language: An analysis of the accessibility of United States federal laws over time","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S. de Souza","F.

Over several generations, learners' biases for simple and informative systems can guide language evolution. Over repeated instances of dyadic communication, the principle of least effort dictates that speakers should bias systems towards simplicity and listeners towards informativity, similarly guiding language evolution. At the same time, it has been argued that learners only provide a bias for simplicity and, thus, users must provide a bias for informativity. To what extent do languages evolve during acquisition versus use? Here, we address this question by formally defining and investigating the communicative efficiency of acquisition trajectories. We illustrate our approach using colour-naming systems, replicating the communicative efficiency model of Zaslavsky et al. (2018) and the acquisition model of Beekhuizen and Stevenson (2018).

The contrast perception heuristic supports efficient audience design, allowing speakers to produce referential expressions with minimum expenditure of cognitive resources, while facilitating the listener's visual search for the referent. We tested the perceptual contrast hypothesis in three language-production experiments. Experiment 1 revealed that speakers overspecify color adjectives in polychrome displays, whereas in monochrome displays they overspecified other properties that were contrastive. Further support for the contrast perception hypothesis comes from a re-analysis of previous work, which confirmed that color contrast elicits color overspecification when detected in a given display, but not when detected across monochrome trials. Experiment 2 revealed that even atypical colors (which are often overspecified) are only mentioned if there is color contrast. In Experiment 3, participants named a target color faster in monochrome than in polychrome displays, suggesting that the effect of color contrast is not analogous to ease of production. We conclude that the tendency to overspecify color in polychrome displays is not a bottom-up effect driven by the visual salience of color as a property, but possibly a learned communicative strategy. We discuss the implications of our account for pragmatic theories of referential communication and models of audience design, challenging the view that overspecification is a form of egocentric behavior.","tags":null,"title":"Contrast perception as a visual heuristic in the formulation of referential expressions","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://mollicaf.github.io/people/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Meet the Team","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["P.

The standard pragmatic view holds that the informativity of a referential expression depends on pragmatic contrast: color adjectives should be used to contrast competitors of the same kind to preempt an ambiguity (e.g., between two triangles of different colors), otherwise they are redundant. Here we propose an alternative to the standard view, the incremental efficiency hypothesis, according to which the efficiency of a referential expression must be calculated incrementally, over the entire visual context. This is the first theoretical account of referential efficiency that is sensitive to the incrementality of language processing, making different cross-linguistic predictions depending on word order. Experiment 1 confirmed that English speakers produced more redundant color adjectives (e.g., ‘the blue triangle’) than Spanish speakers (e.g., ‘el triángulo azul’), but both language groups used more redundant color adjectives in denser displays where it would be more efficient. In Experiments 2a and 2b, we used eye tracking to show that pragmatic contrast is not a processing constraint. Instead, incrementality and efficiency determine that English listeners establish color contrast across categories (BLUE SHAPES  TRIANGULAR ONE), whereas Spanish listeners establish color contrast within a category (TRIANGLES  BLUE ONE). Spanish listeners, however, reversed their visual search strategy when tested in English immediately after. Our results show that speakers and listeners of different languages exploit word order to increase communicative efficiency.

Surprisingly, language experience did not influence recall, nor was there an interaction between legal register and language experience on recall or comprehension.

Two key features of sentences are typically confounded in natural linguistic input: words in sentences (a) are semantically and syntactically combinable into phrase- and clause-level meanings, and (b) occur in an order licensed by the language’s grammar. Inspired by recent psycholinguistic work establishing that language processing is robust to word order violations, we hypothesized that the core linguistic computation is composition, and, thus, can take place even when the word order violates the grammatical constraints of the language. This hypothesis predicts that a linguistic string should elicit a sentence-level response in the language network provided that the words in that string can enter into dependency relationships as in typical sentences. We tested this prediction across two fMRI experiments (total N = 47) by introducing a varying number of local word swaps into naturalistic sentences, leading to progressively less syntactically well-formed strings. Critically, local dependency relationships were preserved because combinable words remained close to each other. As predicted, word order degradation did not decrease the magnitude of the blood oxygen level–dependent response in the language network, except when combinable words were so far apart that composition among nearby words was highly unlikely. This finding demonstrates that composition is robust to word order violations, and that the language regions respond as strongly as they do to naturalistic linguistic input, providing that composition can take place.","tags":null,"title":"Composition is the core driver of the language-selective network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["F.

In this thesis, we sketch out a first-principles account of lexical-conceptual development and implement this model framework for the case of children learning kinship. Kinship is a valuable semantic domain to investigate because children show the same developmental trajectory for early word (mis)use, as in their first year of life, spread out over nine years. A major limitation of evaluating this model and all models of conceptual development is that we have poor intuitions about how children make use of data. To remedy this, we build a data analysis model to investigate the profile of data usage in word learning; although this technique will be broadly applicable to developmental science. We then illustrate how this technique can be used to check the first principles model of inductive learning and investigate the learning process by compiling a large cross-cultural dataset assessing children's knowledge of exact number words. We then take a step back from the learning mechanism and use Fermi-estimation and information theoretic techniques to quantify the scale of language learning tasks and highlight the likelihood of sophisticated learning mechanisms for word meanings.","tags":[],"title":"The Human Learning Machine: Rational Constructivist Models of Conceptual Development","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

A number of recent studies have suggested that Contextual Diversity (CD) is a better metric of retrieval processes than word frequency. Motivated by these findings, we sketch an active account of lexical access during sentence processing: language users store statistics about contextualized lexical representations and use lexical-contextual relations to both construct context and predict words given the context. In line with our account, we provide evidence from a frequency judgment experiment suggesting that words are not stored independently of their contexts of use. To further examine CD effects in reading, we analyzed reading times in self-paced reading and eye-tracking corpora. We demonstrate that as context is constructed, the role of CD in lexical retrieval is attenuated, reflecting a trade-off between context construction and contextualized word prediction.","tags":null,"title":"A context constructivist account of contextual diversity.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L.

At the same time, we also develop representations for things that are similar to what we have experienced. Traditionally, similarity-based and rule-based systems have been used as distinct models to capture conceptual representation. However, it seems implausible that we do not flexibly deploy both systems. Whether both systems can be used simultaneously to represent components of a single concept is an open empirical question. One example suggesting that the use of both systems is possible is the concept of a ZEBRA , which looks like a horse but striped.

Our analysis evaluated theoretically motivated potential predictors of certainty to determine how well each predicted participants’ subjective reports of certainty. Regression analyses that controlled for individual differences demonstrated that despite learning curves tracking the ideal learning models, reported certainty was best explained by performance rather than measures derived from a learning model.

In this paper, we propose a statistically principled model of conceptual development grounded in the trade-off between simplicity and fit to the data. We run our model based on informant-provided family trees and the real-life characteristic features of people on those trees. We demonstrate that the characteristic-to-defining shift does not necessarily depend on discrete change in representation or processes. Instead, the shift could fall out naturally from statistical inference over conceptual hypotheses. Our model finds that the shift occurs even when abstract logical relations are present from the outset of learning as long as characteristic features are informative but imperfect in their ability to capture the underlying concept to be learned—a property of our elicited features.","tags":null,"title":"A rational constructivist account of the characteristic to defining shift.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["F.

How can people read material so quickly in spite of information processing limitations suggested by sentence processing theories? One possibility is that surprisal effects on reading time, the hallmark of processing difficulty under sentence processing theories, might arise from perceptual processing, implying no relation between surprisal and sentence processing difficulty. In this paper, we conducted a novel self-paced rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) experiment, which controlled perceptual processes to probe for sentence processing related surprisal effects. We further tested how readers might compensate for information processing limits during RSVP.

Further, the precise way in which data influence learning on a large scale is unknown—experimental results reveal that children can rapidly learn words from single instances as well as by aggregating ambiguous information across multiple situations. We analyze Wordbank, a large cross-linguistic dataset of word acquisition norms, using a statistical waiting time model to quantify the role of data in early language learning, building off Hidaka (2013). We find that the model both fits and accurately predicts the shape of children’s growth curves. Further analyses of model parameters suggest a primarily data-driven account of early word learning. The parameters of the model directly characterize both the amount of data required and the rate at which informative data occurs. With high statistical certainty, words require on the order of ∼ 10 learning instances, which occur on average once every two months. Our method is extremely simple, statistically principled, and broadly applicable to modeling data-driven learning effects in development.","tags":null,"title":"How data drives early word learning: a cross-linguistic waiting time analysis.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y.

This work has put forth a variety of theories about the meaning of most, including that it naturally relies on cardinality, its verification process is closely tied to its underlying semantics, and that logically equivalent meanings of most have been distinguished using simple psychophysical tasks. Here, we show that subjects’ performance in truth judgments tasks for most likely relies on a wide family of strategies, with a bias towards using cardinality-based strategies. The choice between these strategies is context-dependent, variable between participants, and sensitive to task-level factors like the number of trials participants are asked to complete. These results indicate that there is unlikely to be a single, simple formalization how most is computed, even in controlled laboratory tasks involving dot arrays.
